hello world!

I am Zach Whitehead. I am graduating in May 2017 from Anderson University with an Information Systems major. The languages that I am proficient or familiar with include: C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, Visual Basic. I am currently programming the most in Python and like this language a lot! It is super powerful and easy to use!
